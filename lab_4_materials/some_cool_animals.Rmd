##### A note on this project:

The organization of this document probably seems strange. That's because it's part of an entire multi-part lab for ESM 206, which students will create in multiple projects (but are combined here for easier sharing). Hence the weird unrelated pieces all put together in this project (students will create Parts 2 & 3 as separate projects).
